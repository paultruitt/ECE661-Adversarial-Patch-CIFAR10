# ECE661-Adversarial-Patch-CIFAR10
Code for generation of adversarial patch attacks on CIFAR-10 classifiers in PyTorch. Created by Alok Malhotra and Paul Truitt. Used as final project for Duke University's ECE661 by Yiran Chen. Based on "Adversarial Patch" by Brown et al., but adjusted for Alex Krizhevsky's CIFAR-10 dataset. Patches designed for six Yaofo Chen's pretrained CIFAR-10 classifiers.
